A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers. This solution uses Python, Node.js, .NET, with Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage.

## Prerequisite

- Docker Desktop
- Enable Kubernetes with Kind cluster

## Bringing up the application stack

```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

The `vote` app will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and the `results` will be at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).




## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.excalidraw.png)

* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which collects new votes
* A [.NET](/worker/) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](/result) web app which shows the results of the voting in real time



## Option 1: Using K8s YAML file

- Stop the compose services

```
docker compose down
```

- Go to k8s-specification directory and run the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s-specifications
```


```
deployment.apps/db created
service/db created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/result created
service/result created
deployment.apps/vote created
service/vote created
deployment.apps/worker created
```

- Port forwarding

```
kubectl port-forward svc/vote 5000:8080
```

## Option 2: Using Compose Bridge

## Converting to K8s objects

Select the  Compose Stack under Docker Dashboard and you'll see View Configuration.

## Notes

The voting application only accepts one vote per client browser. It does not register additional votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.

This isn't an example of a properly architected perfectly designed distributed app... it's just a simple
example of the various types of pieces and languages you might see (queues, persistent data, etc), and how to
deal with them in Docker at a basic level.
