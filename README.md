A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers. This solution uses Python, Node.js, .NET, with Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage.

## Prerequisite

- Docker Desktop
- Enable Kubernetes with Kind cluster

## Bringing up the application stack

```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

The `vote` app will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and the `results` will be at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).




## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.excalidraw.png)

* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which collects new votes
* A [.NET](/worker/) worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](/result) web app which shows the results of the voting in real time



## Converting to K8s objects

Select the  Compose Stack under Docker Dashboard and you'll see View Configuration.

## Notes

The voting application only accepts one vote per client browser. It does not register additional votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.

This isn't an example of a properly architected perfectly designed distributed app... it's just a simple
example of the various types of pieces and languages you might see (queues, persistent data, etc), and how to
deal with them in Docker at a basic level.
